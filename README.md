# React TreeMap - IBGE Data

This project is a simple TreeMap built with React, showcasing age groups distribution across different regions of Brazil. It communicates with the IBGE API to fetch data and visualize it in an interactive way.

## Overview

The TreeMap is a data visualization technique that displays hierarchical data as nested rectangles. In this project, we focus on representing age groups in various regions of Brazil.

## Features

- **React-Based:** Built entirely with React to provide a lightweight and efficient user interface.
- **IBGE Data:** Retrieves data from the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) API to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- **No External Libraries:** Demonstrates the power of React without relying on external charting libraries.
